# Rolling Coin Physics Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the rolling coin simulation to properly demonstrate the no-slip rolling constraint where the contact point between the coin and floor has zero velocity.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Visualization Features

#### Contact Point Trail
- Added a red trail that tracks the path of the contact point
- When enabled with the "Contact Trail" button, this shows that the contact point moves in a straight line along the ground
- The trail demonstrates that the contact point has zero velocity relative to the ground at each instant

#### Velocity Vectors
- Added visual representation of velocities at three key points:
  - **Center velocity (green)**: Shows the linear velocity of the coin's center
  - **Contact point velocity (red)**: Should always be near zero, demonstrating no-slip condition
  - **Top point velocity (blue)**: Should be 2x the center velocity

#### Enhanced Coin Visualization
- Added numbered spokes (0, 1, 2, 3) for better rotation visibility
- Larger, more visible contact point marker in red
- Grid marks on the ground for reference

### 2. Physics Verification

The implementation correctly enforces the no-slip rolling constraint:
- Linear velocity: `v = R × ω`
- Angular velocity: `ω = L / I` where `I = ½mR²` for a disk
- Contact point velocity: `v_contact = v_center - ω × R = 0`

### 3. Real-time Feedback
- Added display of contact point speed (should always be ≈0)
- Shows all relevant physics parameters: mass, radius, moment of inertia, angular momentum, angular velocity, and linear velocity

### 4. Test Suite
Created `test_rolling_physics.html` to verify:
- No-slip condition (contact point has zero velocity)
- Point velocities at different locations on the coin
- Angular momentum conservation
- Rolling distance consistency

## How to Use

1. **Contact Trail**: Click to see the path traced by the contact point. A straight horizontal line proves proper rolling.
2. **Show Velocities**: Click to see velocity vectors at key points on the coin.
3. **Adjust Parameters**: 
   - Mass and Radius affect the moment of inertia
   - Angular Momentum determines the rolling speed
   - Time Scale speeds up or slows down the animation

## Physics Explanation

For a coin rolling without slipping:
- The contact point is instantaneously at rest (zero velocity relative to ground)
- The coin rotates about this instantaneous contact point
- The center of mass moves with velocity `v = R × ω`
- Every point on the coin has velocity determined by its distance from the contact point

This creates the characteristic rolling motion where:
- Points ahead of the contact move forward and down
- Points behind the contact move forward and up
- The top of the coin moves at twice the center's velocity
